# Animal Fun Facts — React JSX Practice

This is a small React exercise based on **“Animal Fun Facts”** from Codecademy. The focus was on practicing foundational **React** and **JSX** concepts.

🔗 **[Live Demo](https://fatimaov.github.io/codecademy-animal-fun-facts/)**

## What I Practiced
- Running a Codecademy React exercise locally instead of inside the platform environment
- Setting up **React**, **ReactDOM**, and a **JSX compiler** via CDN
- Adapting starter code designed for Codecademy’s setup to work with a custom local configuration
- Working with JSX syntax, rendering logic, and mounting UI to the DOM using `createRoot`
- Understanding differences between global scripts (CDN) and module-based setups
- Making small layout adjustments for readability and personal preference

I kept the original theme of the exercise but replaced the provided images with AI-generated visuals to improve the appearance. The goal was not to redesign the interface, only to apply minor visual tweaks.
